This will help in understanding and using this library successfully.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```npm install node-google-prediction```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    var Client = require('node-google-prediction');\r\n    var client = new Client({claimSetISS        : //The Service Account email. Check your Gogole Console -> API Access,\r\n                             pemPath            : //Absolute or relative path to the service account private key (in .pem format - Details below on how to convert from .pk12 to .pem)\r\n                             modelInsertFields  : //Defaults are provided in config/config.js but you may want to provide different ones\r\n                            });\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    SomeModule.getToken = function(cb) {\r\n\r\n      client.accessTokenRequest(function(err, data, response) {\r\n        if(err) {\r\n          return cb(err);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        //You may want to handle response.statusCode if http 401 Unauthorised is received!\r\n        if(response && response.statusCode && response.statusCode > 399) {\r\n          return cb(new Error('HTTP status code: ', response.statusCode));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var token = data.access_token;\r\n        return cb(null, token);\r\n\r\n        // Cache your token as it is valid for 1 hour and you can reuse. Only make a fresh token request if HTTP 401 is received.\r\n        // **Note** is down to you to cache and reuse an access token correctly so ensure you handle HTTP401 in other calls to Client.\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Hint:** Look at test/system/testClient.js for further usage/implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Running tests\r\nDue to the nature of the Google Prediction API, in order to run tests you will need to provide some details withing\r\nconfig/config.js. This is so you can provide your own Service Account details and test your own trained models.\r\n\r\nWhen running test/testClient.js it will run a call to Client.js insert() function. **Warning** this will retrain your model.\r\nI have structured the test such that if you don't provide a test Storage Data Location in config/config.js then this test\r\nwill not run.\r\n\r\n##Creating you .pem file\r\n**Note:** That when creating a Service Account via the Google Console you will be given a .pk12 file. This library works\r\nby passing in a .pem file so you can convert it using openssl by running the following command\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n    openssl pkcs12 -in originalKey.p12 -out convertedKey.pem -nodes -clcerts\r\n```\r\nThe result will be the key and certificate. You can keep it in one file or split it into two separate files.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nReleased fully under [MIT license] (http://viktort.mit-license.org)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
